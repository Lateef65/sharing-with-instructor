Interactive Schemes: Look for interactive platforms or programming environments where you can experiment with different data structures and sorting algorithms. Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codecademy often offer interactive coding environments where you can test and run code.

Testing Data Structures: Start by exploring common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables. Experiment with creating, inserting, deleting, and searching elements in these data structures. Understand their properties, advantages, and use cases.

Testing Sorting Algorithms: Similarly, experiment with various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heap sort, and others. Test these algorithms with different input sizes and types of data to observe their performance.

Identifying Unfamiliar Data Structures and Algorithms: As you explore, make note of any data structures or sorting algorithms that you are not yet familiar with. These might include more specialized data structures like trie, AVL tree, red-black tree, or sorting algorithms like shell sort, counting sort, radix sort, etc.

Reasons for Not Mastering: Reflect on why you haven't mastered these unfamiliar data structures and algorithms. It could be due to complexity, lack of exposure, or difficulty in understanding their implementation or use cases.
